This is the project I am currently working on.

I am trying to build a PKMS (Personnal Knowledge Management System) using LLMs.

The idea is that : 

* 1 - the user writes personnal notes into the system (especially knowledge-related notes like notes from a book/lesson)
* 2 - he/she also writes what he/she is trying to achieve with these notes (a specific text for each topic)
* 3 - then the AI LMM powered agent aims at helping to make a good use of her/his notes
* 4 - the core idea is that the textual reactions of the user to the propositions of the agent are saved, in order to build, alongside the notes, a specific file that aims at orientate the agent about the way it has to make sense of the notes for the user
* 5 - this file aims at capturing the meta-motivation the user has, to learn a specific topic
* 6 - I believe that such a file (which can be pure text), plays a essential role in the process of learning, because it is highly personalized


I am currently trying different kind of architectures (LocalLLM, OpenAI API, Tree Of Thoughts, LangChain...) and working on Javascript/CSS UI features
